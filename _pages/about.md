Hello, Welcome to my home page. I am Sourish Chatterjee. I am Master's student at IIT Hyderabad in Department of Electrical Engineering. My specialisation is Signal Processing and Communication. I am a Data Science enthusiast with my experience in Image Procesing and Speech Processing projects.

I like to participate in Kaggle Competitions.

I also like to play Table Tennis, Football and Chess. A game of Chess is a real icebreaker for me. See you at chess.com
